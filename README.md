uTile is a programmanle logic controller for the Atmel/Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller. It works on the Arduino UNO or Nano controller boards.

uTile comes with its own integrated editor and does not need any external programming editor or cross-compiler. It supports permanent storage of user programs in EEPROM, can save/restore programs to the host PC disc files, and can run unattended in stand-alone applications.

User interface is provided by the Minicom serial communications program. Similar terminal emulators like PuTTY or the Arduino IDE terminal also work.

Getting started:
Download the latest m328-utile-x.y-tar.gz file (x.y is the version number) and extract the m328-utile.hex binary executable image file from the archive. Flash the image to ATmega328P and reprogram the fuse bytes as per instructions in the Instructions Manual.

Connect the controller board to the host PC with USB cable, start Minicom and uTile PLC is up and running.
